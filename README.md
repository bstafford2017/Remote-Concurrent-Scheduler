  This is our Fall 2019 - Spring 2020 Senior Capstone for the Univerisity of North Dakota Computer Science Department. Our project is a digital signage scheduling solution for the Conference Room in Upson II. We have setup two Raspberry Pi's (one for the web server and database and another for the 7" display).
