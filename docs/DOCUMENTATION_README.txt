This is the guide to setting up new Raspberry Pi's as Servers or Displays.

Starting off you may need to change the internet, keyboard, and (if not already) enable 
automatic login for the user 'pi'. These setting can be changed using the command:
sudo raspi-config

If you ever are prompted for a password, the default for a pi is 'raspberry'.
The FIRST step to take on either Raspberry Pi is to turn off Bluetooth.

For Server Pi's use the following documents in order:
Server Pi setup.txt
MySQL Installation.txt
Pi Network Installation.txt


For Display Pi's simply refer to:
Display Pi setup.txt

Also included in docs you will see the folder pi-case. This contains the two final
designs for Server Pi and Display Pi. The is also a standard case that has all
ports uncovered. These have been included to allow for future improvements or
modifications. One possible change would be to reopen the slot for the TFT screen's
ribbon cable to enter the case.
The .f3d is the standard Fusion 360 file in which these desgins were originally 
created. There are also copies for Autodesk Inventor 2019.ipt and the native
CAD file .dwg.
